## Introduction
This project is the final project of the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree program.

The complete Analysis can be found in the Starbucks_Capstone_Final.ipynb notebook.
The additional functions used for this analysis can be found in the helperfunctions.py file.

This analysis was performed as a final project within the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree. For this project a simulated data was provided, which mimics the customer behaviour of the Starbucks rewards mobile app.Â 
Within this app a user gets send out an offer once every few days onto the mobile app. Those offers differ in nature, so it can be either an informational advertisement for a drink or an offer, where the user receives a discount or a BOGO (buy one get one free). One thing to mention here is that those offers have a validity period in which those offers need to be completed, otherwise they expire and the user can no longer receive the reward.
